Project is under development 

The objective of this project is to design and develop a low-code automation platform that enables users to create, execute, and monitor workflows using a visual DAG-based interface, similar to tools like n8n and Zapier. The system allows non-developers to automate multi-step processes by connecting services, APIs, and background jobs.
